\section{Question 7}
Housing\_train is a 404 observations of 14 variables (404x14). There are 506 X variables in the original housing data. The housing\_train data set has 102 less X variables than the orignial housing set.  

\section{LASSO Model Results}
The in sample RMSE is 0.172 while the out of sample RMSE was 0.390. The optimal $\lambda$ is 0.00355648.  

\section{Ridge Regression Model Results}
The out of sample RMSE is 0.173. The optimal $\lambda$ is 0.001389495.

\section{Question 10}
You cannot run a simple linear regression on a dataset with more columns than rows. You would use a LASSO or Ridge model to do so. With how close my RMSEs are for both sets of models, the models are different due to variance rather than bias.
