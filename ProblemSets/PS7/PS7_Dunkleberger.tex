\section{Initial Guesses}

The log of wages are missing at a 25\% rate. I think it is likely to be missing at random (MAR). I used datasummary\_skim() to create that table. 

\section{Model Summary}

It appears the complete cases and predicted values are the same formula. That could be an error in my code or it could be that the formulas for those regressions are similar. There seems to be a significance between the models and what the actual value is. These models that I created do not seem to be close to the true value of 0.093. I do not think these models are the most accurate or true. The estimates are very close to each other. There might not be too much of a difference between the estimations in those estimates. 

\section{Final Project}
I have not started thinking in earnest about what I am going to do with the final project. I do know I want to use the hockeyR package for the data. I might do something with goal numbers based on what I encountered in PS6. Finding a relationship or predicting goals for the next year could be interesting. I have not given it much thought beyond that honestly.
