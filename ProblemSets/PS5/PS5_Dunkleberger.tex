\section{Web Scraping}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item I chose to scrape a table listing goalie stats from IcyData. This data interests me in possibly finding  relationships between goalie Wins and advanced stats like goals saved above average (GAAA). It could be useful for an analysis like that in the future; maybe even for the final in this class. I used Grant McDermott's notes from class to help me format the data. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{API}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The API that I found was in the hockeyR package for NHL play by play data. This data can be parsed down to focus on plays with an empty net. My thesis is on if pulling the goalie leads to more points and playoff appearances in a season. Play by play data is the best way to identify if the net is empty and whether that leads to an overtime point or a loss in regulation. It allows me to pick out the situations I need in the data. 
\end{enumerate}
