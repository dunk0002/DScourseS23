\section{Body}

I took this class after a recommendation from my advisor, Dr. Daniel Larson. I was looking for a class that will teach me some properties of data science useful to sports data analytics. He mentioned how this course uses programming and useful principles needed in analytics. It piqued my interest and I enrolled in the course. I do not have an idea for the project yet; however, I feel it could come naturally once I get into a rhythm for how the class operates. My goal is to get a good grade in this class and develop new tools that will make me stand out on the job market. After graduation, I hope to one day work in the analytics department for a professional sports team in North America. The dream is on working on in game decisions (e.g. going for it on 4th down in football) but working in the business office could satisfy that goal.
